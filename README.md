## Exploring Diverse Data Projects: Churn Prediction, Heart Disease Detection, and Music Recommendations



Three distinct projects encompassing customer churn prediction, early heart disease detection, and personalized music recommendations, underscore the power of data-driven insights across domains.

# Churn Prediction:
Predicting customer churn using machine learning models based on customer data like credit score, age, tenure, and more. The aim is to determine whether a customer will leave or stay with the company. Different models will be explored to identify factors that contribute to customer attrition.

# Heart Disease Prediction:
Developing a predictive model for heart disease detection using a dataset with attributes such as age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Multiple algorithms will be compared, including Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, to predict the likelihood of heart disease and improve early diagnosis.

# Spotify Recommender System:
Building a song recommendation system for music platforms like Spotify. Utilizing factors like song genres, popularity, danceability, and energy to suggest similar songs to users. The K Nearest Neighbors algorithm is employed to find song neighbors, with variations in feature selection to enhance recommendations.

Each project tackles a distinct problem domain, leveraging data analysis, machine learning, and recommendation algorithms to provide valuable insights and solutions within their respective contexts.
